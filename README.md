# "Guess Who?" game

## Purpose

This is a project aimed at practising front-end development (and maybe later back-end as well).

## How to play

### Accessing the site

#### Option A: Github Page

Visit this page: https://anthonyledu.github.io/Guess-Who/

#### Option B: Localhost

Clone the repo and copy/paste the root folder path in your web browser

### Playing

For now, the game only provides a passive one-player board. Both players will need to visit the page using their own device.

1. When acessing the page (or refreshing it) the board of cards is shuffled initialized. A new random secret card is also picked for you.

2. By clicking on any card, you can flip it back /front.

## Options

Current options include :

- Player's color : change the cards border and back color
